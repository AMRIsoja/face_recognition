    - CPU: Intel Core i5 (7th Gen or newer) / AMD Ryzen 5 or equivalent.
    - RAM: 16 GB or more.
    - Storage: 256 GB SSD or higher.
    - GPU (Optional but Recommended for faster processing): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (e.g., GTX 1050 Ti or higher) for dlib GPU acceleration.

Ubuntu (Termux proot-distro)
This method allows you to run an Ubuntu environment on your Android device via Termux, providing a Linux-like environment for Python development. Note that performance will be limited compared to a native PC setup, and direct camera access might require workarounds.

1. Install Termux:
    - Download and install Termux from F-Droid (recommended for latest version) or Google Play Store.

2. Update Termux & Install proot-distro:
    ```pkg update && pkg upgrade -y```
    ```pkg install proot-distro -y```

3. Install Ubuntu:

    ```proot-distro install ubuntu```

4. Login to Ubuntu:
    ```proot-distro login ubuntu```
    You are now in your Ubuntu environment.

5. Update Ubuntu & Install Build Tools:

    '''apt update && apt upgrade -y```
    ```apt install python3 python3-pip cmake build-essential -y```
build-essential` includes `g++` and other necessary compilers for `dlib`.

6. Install Project Libraries:
    ```pip install opencv-python face-recognition dlib numpy pandas fpdf2```

    - Note on dlib: dlib compilation can be resource-intensive and might take a long time or fail on Termux due to limited resources. Ensure your device has enough free RAM. If pip install dlib fails, you might need to try a pre-compiled wheel if available for your specific Termux/Python architecture, or stick to a native PC setup for better reliability.

7. Tkinter Dependencies (for GUI):

    ```apt install python3-tk -y```

**Windows**

5. **Usage**
Once all libraries are installed:

8. **Coding Strategy**
The project follows a modular and object-oriented programming (OOP) approach to ensure maintainability, scalability, and readability.

**Modularity**: The codebase is divided into distinct modules (e.g., face_recognition_module, database_module, report_generator) where each module is responsible for a specific set of functionalities. This separation of concerns makes it easier to develop, debug, and update individual parts without affecting the entire system.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Key entities like User, AttendanceRecord, FaceRecognizer, and DatabaseManager are represented as classes. This allows for encapsulation of data and methods, promoting code reusability and a clearer logical structure. For instance, a FaceRecognizer class would handle all logic related to face detection and comparison, while a DatabaseManager class would abstract all interactions with the SQLite database.

**Error Handling**: Robust try-except blocks are implemented throughout the code to gracefully handle potential runtime errors (e.g., camera not found, database connection issues, file I/O errors), preventing unexpected crashes and providing informative feedback to the user.

**Comments & Docstrings**: Extensive comments and Python docstrings are used to explain complex logic, function parameters, return values, and overall module purpose, facilitating understanding for future developers.

9. **Testing Strategy**
A multi-faceted testing strategy was employed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system:

    **Unit Testing**: Individual functions and methods within modules (e.g., database insertion, face encoding extraction) are tested in isolation to verify their correctness. Python's unittest module or pytest can be used for this.

    **Integration Testing**: Different modules are tested together to ensure they interact correctly (e.g., face recognition module successfully passing data to the database module).

    **System Testing**: The entire application is tested as a whole to verify that all features work as expected, from user registration to report generation. This includes testing the GUI's responsiveness and functionality.

    **Performance Testing**: Evaluating the real-time recognition speed and database query times to ensure the system meets performance requirements.

    **Edge Case Testing**: Testing the system under non-ideal conditions, such as varying lighting, different angles, and partial obstructions, to assess its robustness.

    **Data Validation**: Ensuring that data stored in the SQLite database is consistent and correctly formatted.

10. **Common Challenges & Solutions**
During the development of this project, several common challenges were encountered:

**dlib Installation Complexity**:

    **Challenge**: dlib (a core dependency of face_recognition) requires C++ build tools (like Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows or build-essential on Linux) and CMake for compilation, which can be tricky to set up.

    **Solution**: Provide clear, step-by-step installation instructions for required build tools. For Windows, advise using pre-compiled .whl files if direct pip install dlib fails.

**Environmental Factors Affecting Recognition Accuracy**:

    **Challenge**: Facial recognition performance is highly sensitive to factors like lighting, facial pose, and obstructions (e.g., glasses, masks).

    **Solution**: Implement best practices for face capture during enrollment (e.g., clear lighting, neutral expression, multiple angles). Acknowledge this as a limitation and suggest future enhancements like liveness detection.

**Real-time Performance**:

    **Challenge**: Processing video frames and performing facial recognition in real-time can be computationally intensive, leading to lag on lower-end hardware.

    **Solution**: Optimize code for efficiency (e.g., processing frames at a lower resolution, using multi-threading for GUI responsiveness if recognition is on a separate thread). Recommend adequate hardware specifications.

**Database Management**:

    **Challenge**: Ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of facial encodings (large numerical arrays) and attendance data in SQLite.

    **Solution**: Store facial encodings as BLOBs or serialized strings in SQLite. Implement proper indexing on relevant columns (e.g., user ID, timestamp) for faster queries.

**Ethical Considerations & Privacy**:

    **Challenge**: Facial recognition raises privacy concerns. Storing raw images is generally not recommended.

    **Solution**: Design the system to store only numerical facial encodings, not actual images. Emphasize data security and privacy in documentation.

11. **Documentation Plan**
A comprehensive documentation plan ensures the project is well-understood and maintainable:

    **README.md** (This File): Provides a high-level overview, installation guide, usage instructions, and project structure.

    **Code Comments & Docstrings**: In-line comments explain complex logic, and docstrings for modules, classes, and functions provide detailed explanations of their purpose, parameters, and return values.

    **User Manual**: A separate document (e.g., PDF) detailing how to use the GUI, register users, mark attendance, and generate reports.

    **Developer Documentation**: More in-depth technical documentation covering API design, database schema, algorithms used, and internal workings for future development.

    **Project Report**: The formal academic report detailing research, methodology, implementation, results, and conclusions.

12. **Project Progress Tracking**
Project progress was meticulously tracked using a combination of a structured checklist and a spreadsheet, ensuring all tasks were managed effectively from inception to completion.
